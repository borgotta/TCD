True Corner Detector

Third year course work.

Detects corners on images using 3 different algorithms (feature detection):
1. [The FÃ¶rstner corner detector] (http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/fileadmin/publication/papers/1987/foerstner87.fast.pdf)
2. [The SUSAN corner detector] (http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.24.2763)
3. [Simple Harris operator] (http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/1988/avc-88-023.pdf)

I believe you can compile this project using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 or 2010. The project was written long ago sometimes using authors own code as a basis (certainly true for SUSAN for it was written in C).
